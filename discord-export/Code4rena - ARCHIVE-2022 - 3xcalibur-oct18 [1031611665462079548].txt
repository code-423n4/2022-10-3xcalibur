These kinda reports will be OOS right?

"not eligible for awards."


[10/19/2022 06:39] 0xkitsune
The findings that are identified in the c4udit report are considered public and wont count or be eligible for rewards. But automated reports are allowed, just as long as the quality of the report is high enough.

where can I find Solidly contracts?


[10/19/2022 12:34] 0xmatt#3768
Just to confirm, from the scope section: "The following changes makes up the scope of the 3xcalibur 10-2022 contest:"
Does this mean only the changed areas (e.g. whitelisting mechanism in Voter.sol) are in scope, or the full named contracts on the files in scope list?


[10/19/2022 12:44] .mathieu
What are some possible values for the `boost` variable in the Minter.sol file ?
Doesn't seem very clear to me


[10/19/2022 13:24] illilli000
100% of the files from the scope table are in scope

Lots looks based on Uniswapv2, might be some Curve in there but haven't looked yet.


[10/19/2022 15:14] dsubd1subd2
it's Solidly fork with some improvements + a bit of synthetix staking contract logic as I understand correctly and the only docs I found is on their website: 3xcalibur.com

[10/20/2022 13:54] .mathieu
anyone can help about this ?


[10/20/2022 14:02] flyjgh
Hi, `boost` is an additional amount of token that can be added to the calculated amount to be distributed every week.
It is initially set to 0 for the first epoch, then will be considered to be increased by 0.15% of the liquidity mining target.


[10/20/2022 14:14] .mathieu
okay so it could be a high value since this is expressed in wei right ?


[10/20/2022 14:15] flyjgh
Yes, typically some value raised to 10^18


[10/20/2022 14:15] .mathieu
right, thank you!

The scope of analized  files are wrong
In the contest the **contracts/periphery/VotingEscrow.sol** it's out of scope


[10/21/2022 16:02] illilli000
all findings by the tool are invalid, so I don't think that matters


[10/21/2022 16:06] rotcivegaf
I don't understand, so in the report I add the items mentioned in the c4dit? 
Such as the Cache array length outside of loop or the Don't initialize variables with default value


[10/21/2022 16:09] illilli000
you are not supposed to include any findings that are flagged by c4udit

Error in plugin @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan: Etherscan API token "arbGoerliRollup" is for an unsupported network


[10/21/2022 21:25] koolexc
Any hint how to resolve this?


[10/21/2022 21:26] koolexc
I'm using this:

[10/21/2022 21:39] koolexc
Anyone available to give me some hint on this?


[10/21/2022 22:01] illilli000
I don't have the answer to your question but can I ask, what are you trying to do with the deployment? Are the tests not enough for a POC?


[10/21/2022 22:03] koolexc
trying to do so, because the test command with forge is failing too


[10/21/2022 22:03] koolexc

[10/21/2022 22:04] illilli000
did you try the all-in-one command?


[10/21/2022 22:04] koolexc
not sure if I understand what you mean ..


[10/21/2022 22:05] koolexc
there is only one command from what I see

Ah sorry. just noticed the all-in-one command

Hi @Picodes | Angle @IllIllI 

c4udit contains this item about unsafe erc20 for this contest

findings for this would be considered invalid?


[10/23/2022 10:00] illilli000
just pasting the output of the script without analysis is invalid. if you can show that it leads to a medium/high bug with valid reasoning, it will count

[11/23/2022 14:19] cloudellie
Please be patient, we are running QA checks -- hence the PR not having been merged yet.


[11/23/2022 14:48] cloudellie
Here's what I'm seeing (with the caveat that QA checks are still running): 24 wardens found M-08, and this contest's awards were calculated using the 0.6 decrementer. So yes, I believe this is correct. You can see the actual number as the third-to-last value in the csv rows: `0.0005584570954127158`

It rounds out to 0.


[11/23/2022 14:51] cloudellie
column headings can be seen at the top of the csv file: 

`contest,handle,finding,risk,score,pie,split,slice,award,awardCoin,awardUSD`

The shares/pie/split/slice stuff is described here: https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards

We need to update our docs to incorporate some more context around how scoring works, but you can read about that here: https://github.com/code-423n4/org/discussions/50

Hi, has anyone already received these payouts?


[12/17/2022 02:30] catwhiskeys
I checked my metamask today (yes, I've imported polygon network) and there are no payments(

yes, received. Did you add the USDC address on your polygon network?
